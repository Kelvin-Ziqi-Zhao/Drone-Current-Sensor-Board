# Drone Current Sensor Board
High current sensor board for battery+capacitor power supply system
## Components and Design
- Use **RP2040** as MCU, **INA226** as power monitor chip.
- By using **0402** components, the size of module can be greatly reduced
## More Info
- DEBUG, UART test points and IIC select are reserved, which could help us during development
- This is the theory verification PCBA module of my follow-up power system, stay tuned...
>The hardware isn't been tested, please **CHECK THE CIRCUIT** before power-on
